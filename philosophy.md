# Guiding principles                                   


* All principles are guidelines.  Feel free to break them if they
	become a hindrance.

*	Automate whatever you can, starting with the most cognitively
	tedious tasks that are done most frequently.  These may or may
	not be the "slowest" tasks.

*	Aim for composability of snippets; think about how your
	snippets will expand while you are in another snippet.

*	Minimize nuisance navigation: design snippets that place you
	where you are supposed to edit text, and guide you to their exit
	cleanly.

*	Eliminate low-level typesetting.  You should not have to manually
	open or close an environment, enter a backslash, open and close
	command brackets, indent text, and so on.

*	Use composable visual tokens for latex symbols as much as
	possible.  In general, use tokens that trigger your memory the
	best.

*	Exploit vertical space for long equation groups, and tame
	horizontal space.  Use folds to handle long environments.
