# dotfiles

This repository contains a pared-down version of my dotfiles, including
Vim and UltiSnips configuration. Use at your own risk!

The contents of this repository are part of what powers the post I
made on unixporn linked below:

# Credits

Much of the Python code involved in the snippets comes from Honza's
master list : https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets

The implementation of the ```math()``` context comes (to my
knowledge) from Gilles Castel who has a website dedicated to
advanced Latex typesetting in Vim: https://castel.dev/
