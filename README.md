# dotfiles

My Vim and UltiSnips dotfiles with corresponding zathura config.

Use at your own risk.  I use two-space tabs for alignment.

The contents of this repository are part of what powers the post I
made on unixporn linked below, as well as my daily workflow:

If you are interested in this aesthetic, please check the first two
minutes of my work at https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/ek3cyc/cinnamon_soft_mood_and_latex_workflow/

The rest of the video has been surpassed by the first link above,
but I am very fond of the soft style I delivered in the second
link.

# Credits

Much of the Python code involved in the snippets comes from Honza's
master list : https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets

The implementation of the ```math()``` context comes (to my
knowledge) from Gilles Castel who has a website dedicated to
advanced Latex typesetting in Vim: https://castel.dev/
