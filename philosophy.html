<ul>
<li><p>All principles are guidelines. Feel free to break them if they become a hindrance.</p></li>
<li><p>Automate whatever you can, starting with the most cognitively tedious tasks that are done most frequently. These may or may not be the “slowest” tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>Be mindful of composability of snippets: think about how your snippets will expand while you are in another snippet.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize nuisance navigation: design snippets that place you where you are supposed to edit text, and guide you to their exit cleanly.</p></li>
<li><p>Eliminate low-level typesetting. You should not have to manually open or close an environment, enter a backslash, open and close command brackets, indent text, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Use composable visual tokens for latex symbols as much as possible. In general, use tokens that trigger your memory the best.</p></li>
<li><p>Exploit vertical space for long equation groups, and tame horizontal space. Use folds to handle the long environments that may result.</p></li>
</ul>
